## Motivation

This project sought to investigate how fiber deprivation impacts the gut microbiota in a gnotobiotic mouse model consisting of 14 bacterial species.

## Installation

Raw sequences can be obtained from SRA (BioProject PRJNA300261, SRP065682).

## Contributors

Anna M. Seekatz, Mahesh S. Desai, and Eric C. Martens contributed to this code.

## Repository description

**Rcode:** Code for each figure in manuscript.

**Data files:** Data used and created for each figure (including commands in mothur used to process the raw data).

**Figures:** Examples of figures generated by this code.
